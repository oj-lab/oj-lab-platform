# By default, you can override the config by creating a file named in `override` in the config directory.
#
# If you want to override the using config, instead the file name of `override`,
# you need to set env `OJ_LAB_OVERRIDE_CONFIG_NAME` to the name of the config file you want to use.
#
# In this example, setting `OJ_LAB_OVERRIDE_CONFIG_NAME` to `override.example`
# will override the log level to `info`.
